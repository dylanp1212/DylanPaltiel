    <h1>Climate Change Project</h1>
    <p>I am working on a project to educate consumers about the roots of climate change. My research question is: How does blame defecting propaganda and green washing from large companies affect the way consumers think about climate change? I am researching four main subjects: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Causes of climate change</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Current main polluters</li>
                <li>Government inaction</li>
                <li>Corporate control in government</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Blame defecting propaganda</li>
            <ul>
                <li>What it looks like</li>
                <li>Who creates it</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Green washing</li>
            <ul>
                <li>What it looks like</li>
                <li>Who uses it</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Consumer beliefs</li>
            <ul>
                <li>What most consumers believe</li>
                <li>How propaganda affects consumer beliefs</li>
                <li>How green washing affects consumer beliefs</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>After gathering information and data from these areas, I will be able to create an action plan on what consumers need to be educated on and how to educate them. I plan on starting with researching the causes of climate change. This will consist of reading scientific sources about climate change, political sources about corporate control in government and getting feedback from experts on these subjects. Then I will look into propaganda and green washing. To do this I will read about these two techniques and then find examples. I will also get feedback from experts. Finally I will create a survey for consumers in order to collect data about what consumers believe. I will also get feedback from experts on how these beliefs are formed.</p>
